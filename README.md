# Stack Usage App (Not Completed)
This readme.md provides an example of how a stack data structure can be utilized in a TypeScript-based React app. The demonstration involves defining a Stack interface and subsequently implementing it using an ArrayStack class. The stack is then utilized within the App component, which renders buttons for pushing, popping, peeking, and getting the size of the stack, in addition to displaying the current contents of the stack. It is worth noting that the useState hook is leveraged to maintain the current stack and re-render the component as the stack is updated.

It is essential to emphasize that this is only one instance of how DSA can be integrated into a TypeScript-based React app. Depending on the app's requirements, various data structures and algorithms may be necessary. It is also important to mention that this project is still under development, and further work needs to be done.

## Installation
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

1) Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

2) Run the following command to create a new React app with TypeScript:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```
3)Navigate to the newly created directory:

```
bash
Copy code
cd my-app
```

4) Replace the contents of the src/App.tsx file with the code provided in this repository.

5) Run the following command to start the app:
```
npm start
```
This will start the app and open it in your default browser. You should see a page with a "Stack Example" heading and four buttons ("Push", "Pop", "Peek", and "Size") as well as an empty list. You can click the "Push" button to add a new item to the stack, and the other buttons to manipulate and display the stack's contents.

## Usage
To use this app, simply click the "Push" button to add a new item to the stack. The other buttons allow you to manipulate and display the stack's contents:

- "Pop": removes the top item from the stack.
- "Peek": displays the top item on the stack without removing it.
- "Size": displays the current size of the stack.
- The current contents of the stack are displayed in a list below the buttons.
