# Stack Usage App (Not Completed)
This is a simple example that demonstrates the use of a stack data structure in TypeScript within a React app. We define an interface for the Stack, and then implement it using an ArrayStack class. We then use this stack in our App component, which renders buttons for pushing, popping, peeking, and getting the size of the stack, as well as displaying the current contents of the stack. Note that we're using the useState hook to keep track of the current stack, and re-rendering the component when the stack is updated.

This is just one example of how DSA can be used in a React app with TypeScript. Depending on the needs of your app, you may need to use other data structures and algorithms as well. More work need to be done

## Installation
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

1) Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

2) Run the following command to create a new React app with TypeScript:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```
3)Navigate to the newly created directory:

```
bash
Copy code
cd my-app
```

4) Replace the contents of the src/App.tsx file with the code provided in this repository.

5) Run the following command to start the app:
```
npm start
```
This will start the app and open it in your default browser. You should see a page with a "Stack Example" heading and four buttons ("Push", "Pop", "Peek", and "Size") as well as an empty list. You can click the "Push" button to add a new item to the stack, and the other buttons to manipulate and display the stack's contents.

## Usage
To use this app, simply click the "Push" button to add a new item to the stack. The other buttons allow you to manipulate and display the stack's contents:

- "Pop": removes the top item from the stack.
- "Peek": displays the top item on the stack without removing it.
- "Size": displays the current size of the stack.
- The current contents of the stack are displayed in a list below the buttons.
